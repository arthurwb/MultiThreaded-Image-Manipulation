# MultiThreaded-Image-Manipulation </br>
Loads an image, takes out the red, saves it in a different image.  </br>

Does this serially and then in parallel using the Parallel.Invoke control structure in the .Net library System.Threading.Tasks  </br>

Execution time is about 1/2 the time in parallel with three threads.  </br>
